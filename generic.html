                                    <h1>About Ryan</h1>
                                    <p style="text-align:left;"><span class="image right"><img src="images/fun.jpeg" alt="" /></span> Ryan Standridge is recent graduate of Clemson University where he earned a Masters 
                                        of Science in Data Science and Analytics. While working hard in this program, 
                                        he has completed some of his first Data Science/Analytics projects, allowing him to 
                                        expand his knowledge in the Data Science field. <br/><br/>
                                        Before studying at Clemson, he attended a small school in Clinton, South Carolina called 
                                        Presbyterian College, where he majored in Applied Mathematics with minors in Business Administration and Physics. While attending PC, 
                                        he spent four years playing on the Mens Soccer team while also being involved in Greek Life 
                                        as well as associations like the Math Honors Society, Honor Council, and Residence Life. 
                                        Also, while studying at Presbyterian College, he was able to travel to England, where he 
                                        completed a study abroad program in May of 2019. <br/><br/>
                                        Ryan loves to travel, which has led him to many different states and countries, and when he is not traveling, he loves to play sports like 
                                        golf and soccer, spend time with his friends and family, and continually learn about Data Science.</p>
